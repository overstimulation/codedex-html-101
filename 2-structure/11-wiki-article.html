      Ada Lovelace, born in 1815, is often celebrated as the first computer
      programmer. She worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical
      general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, and her notes on the
      engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be
      carried out by a machine.
